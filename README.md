This Python script implements a simple Hangman game. The game starts by prompting the player to enter their name. Then, it randomly selects a word from a word list file named "hangman_wordlist.txt". The player has to guess letters one by one to uncover the hidden word. The player has a limited number of chances to guess wrong letters, represented by a hangman drawing. If the player guesses all the letters correctly within the given chances, they win the game. Otherwise, if they exhaust all their chances, they lose the game. After each game, the player is asked if they want to play again.
